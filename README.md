# voice_control_ui
Attempt to control a Flutter UI conversationally using IBM Watson for intent recognition, entity capturing, and fulfillment to mutate app state accordingly.

Uses [riverpod](https://pub.dev/packages/hooks_riverpod) for state management, and [ibm_watson_assistant](https://pub.dev/packages/ibm_watson_assistant) to integrate IBM Watson.
